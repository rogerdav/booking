Purpose of Application
The Main purpose is to create a application that will allow for a very generic front end to display a calendar and allow for basic booking to be made.
Google calendar looks like the best option for a back end API but that needs more research.
The view should be generic enough to be able to be tailored to suit any sort of enterprise.
The challenge is being able to allow for bookings to be made only for the number of available workers/techs.
The view must be mobile first, and allow for easy adaptation/ alteration for multiply enterprizes.
Visitors need to be given the option of creating a username or continuing as a guest.
